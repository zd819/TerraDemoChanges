some providers only give data when its exists (contrary to myfitnesspal) we request whenever we see dates missing from our own db, we should really not be doing this 
so if theres no data for a certain day it will keep requesting from terra on every frontend request.
can add empty db entry when requesting from terra as it will overwrite if we receive actual data but it will be a placeholder to say weve already requested

data processing needed to discern multiple events in the same day i.e if someone naps mid-day

stuff for activities
