# TerraDemo

This repository contains a webapp designed for Terra as part of our 3rd Year Group Consultancy Project.
It aims to demonstrate the use of Terra's API by displaying a user's wearable data in a visually pleasing way. 

## Backend

The backend is built in Node using the Express framework and was initialised using the template provided by the module.
During development the backend was hosted locally with remote access provided using 'ngrok'. 
The app.js and www file serve to determine general server settings with the routes and function directory serving to directly respond to http requests made to the server.

### Database

We used MongoDB to host user data and connected via a private key not provided in this repository.

## Frontend

The frontend was developed using React with the possibility to use React-Native for any future mobile application.
